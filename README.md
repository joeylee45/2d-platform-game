#Demo 2D Platform Game

This is a sample project that will serve as my learning tool for version control and git.

Scope of the game:
1. The Player GameObject:
  a. Can move around and jump onto platforms.
  b. When falling down they can reset the game
  c. The platform will be in fixed positions => have them move around at a later build.
  d. Create a scoreboard for every platform cleared.
  e. Save data onto the leaderboard when the game ends.
